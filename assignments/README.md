# Docker Assignments

This folder contains in-class tasks and take-home assignments to help students learn Docker through hands-on exercises. Each task references the sample Node webapp in the repository root.

Structure

- `class-task.md` — Short guided activity for a classroom session.
- `task-1.md` — Build and run the image
- `task-2.md` — Inspect image layers and size
- `task-3.md` — Use environment variables and `.env`
- `task-4.md` — Create a multi-stage build to reduce image size

For each task:
- Try to solve it on your own first.
- Use the `solutions/` folder for reference after attempting the task.

Teacher notes: run a quick demo using the provided Dockerfile and the `public/` UI to demonstrate concepts live.
